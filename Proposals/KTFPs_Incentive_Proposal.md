## Summary

Provide a $ 5 million loan to lending protocols to kick-start the money market activity on the Kusama ecosystem


## Proposal

**Context of the proposal**

Kusama needs a structured incentive program to attract customers and showcase its unlimited potential in scalability, efficiency, and cross-chain interoperability.
However, incentives should be wisely directed towards activities that, if adequately rewarded, create a positive feedback loop with a resulting exponential increase in liquidity gathered from outside. 
Lending is one of the essential pillars in a well-functioning DeFi ecosystem because it allows customers to capture opportunities without compromising capital efficiency. 

Other chains are skewing funds towards lending too. The Avalanche Rush program has allocated the highest incentive tranche to AAVE ($ 20 million). 
AAVE Total Value Locked (TVL) on the Avalanche chain has gone from $ 622 million to $ 3.46 billion in just two months. 
Benqi, the Avalanche native lending protocol, has obtained $ 10 million from the Avalanche Rush incentive program.
Its TVL has gone from $ 112 million at the Avalanche Rush announcement date to the current $ 1.85 billion.

**Problem Statement**

The lending activity on Kusama is currently anemic and, without lending/money market opportunities, thereâ€™s little room for onboarding foreign assets on the ecosystem. 
Projects like Angular Finance, an isolated lending pair pallet built on top of Composable Picasso, could help mitigate such a gap by enabling loans on Kusama.

**Proposal**

 Unlock $ 5 million KSM from the Kusama treasury that will be lent to Angular Finance or other lending projects aimed at kick-starting usage of DeFi applications. 

**Budget & payment conditions**

The proposed loan size amounts to $ 5 million KSM for a duration of three months. At expiration date, protocols that received funds will pay the $ 5 million loan back to the Kusama treasury plus any earnings collected during the duration of the loan.
